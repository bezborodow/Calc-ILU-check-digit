# Calc-ILU-check-digit
How is the check digit of a container calculated?

Do you need to check if a container id (ILU code or BIC code) is valid?

Take the javascript function, that I publish with this little project, to find out, if the check digit is correct.


The calculation is based on this page: http://www.gvct.co.uk/2011/09/how-is-the-check-digit-of-a-container-calculated/
